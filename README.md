# Business-Analyser-Tool

This tool extracts desired data from big data with the help of electicsearch

Once we have the desired data we process the data using machine learning libraries of python to generate intuitive graphs

We are using powerfull Machine Learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, MatplotLib, TextBlob, Panda to perform Natural Language Processing. In addition to that we are using cloud based service ElasticSearch to perform data mining of the big data in order to extract the right knowledge.
